# Minimizing-Medical-Appointment-No-Shows-
OBJECTIVE:  To develop a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of a patient missing their scheduled medical appointment, enabling targeted interventions to reduce no-show rates.

DATASETS:
1) Clinic dataset (Toronto)
2) No-show dataset from kaggle (Brazil, for more features and further analysis)

GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS: 
Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Ontario, Canada.

TARGET: 
Patients attending medical appointments in the GTA.

TIMEFRAME:
Analysis of historical data from the past 5 years. 




  Project Workflow: Reducing Patient No-Shows

1. Problem Identification
   Identify the core issue of patient no-shows and its impact on clinic operations.

2. Data Collection
   Gather relevant data such as:

   - Historical appointment data
   - Patient demographics
   - Communication records

3. Data Preprocessing
   Prepare the data for modeling by:

   - Cleaning and transforming the data
   - Handling missing values
   - Performing feature engineering

4. Model Development
   Build predictive models by:

   - Choosing appropriate algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)
   - Training models on the preprocessed dataset

5. Model Validation
   Ensure model accuracy and reliability by:

   - Evaluating model performance using metrics
   - Selecting the best-performing model

6. Intervention Design
   Propose actionable strategies such as:

   - Appointment reminders
   - Transportation assistance
   - Incentives or penalties to reduce no-shows

7. Recommendations & Reporting
   Provide clear, actionable insights and present findings to stakeholders for decision-making.

8. End of Scope
   Define the endpoint of the project scope and summarize deliverables.
